# libacars

libacars is a library for decoding ACARS message contents.

Current stable version: **2.2.0** (released August 21, 2023)

## Supported message types

- [X] FANS-1/A ADS-C (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Contract)
- [X] FANS-1/A CPDLC (Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications)
- [X] MIAM (Media Independent Aircraft Messaging)
- [X] Media Advisory (Status of data links: VDL2, HF, Satcom, VHF ACARS)
- [X] OHMA (diagnostic messages exchanged with Boeing 737MAX aircraft)

## Installation

### Binary packages

64-bit Windows binary packages of stable releases are provided in the
[Releases](https://github.com/szpajder/libacars/releases) section.

Unzip the archive into any directory. You should be able to run example programs
directly from `bin` subdirectory.

### Building from source

Requirements:

- c11-capable C compiler
- cmake 3.1 or later
- zlib 1.2 (optional)
- libxml2 (optional)

The project should build and run correctly on the following platforms:

- Linux i686 and x86_64 (gcc)
- MacOS (clang)
- Windows (mingw or msvc)

#### Installing dependencies

- libacars needs zlib for MIAM and OHMA message decompression. If zlib is not
  present, decompression code will be disabled and compressed messages will be
  left undecoded.  Therefore it is recommended to install zlib development
  package first. On Debian/Raspbian distros it is named `zlib1g-dev`:

```
apt install zlib1g-dev
```

- ACARS and MIAM CORE messages sometimes contain XML documents.  libacars may
  optionally pretty-print these documents, ie. add  proper formatting and
  indentation. To enable this feature, you need libxml2 library:

```
apt install libxml2-dev
```

- OHMA messages contain JSON-encoded data. Decoding these messages requires
  libacars to be built with Jansson library:

```
apt install libjansson-dev
```

#### Compiling libacars (Linux)

- **Option 1:** To run stable and tested code, download the latest stable
  release tarball from [Releases](https://github.com/szpajder/libacars/releases)
  section and unpack it:

```
unzip libacars-x.y.z.zip
cd libacars-x.y.z
```

- **Option 2:** To run the latest development code which has not yet made it
  into a stable release, clone the source repository and checkout the `unstable`
  branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/szpajder/libacars
cd libacars
git checkout unstable
```

`master` branch is always in sync with the latest stable release. `unstable`
branch is where the latest cutting-edge code goes first.

- Configure the build:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

- Inspect the configuration summary in the cmake output and verify if all the
  dependencies have been detected properly:

```
-- libacars configuration summary:
-- - zlib:              requested: ON, enabled: TRUE
-- - libxml2:           requested: ON, enabled: TRUE
-- - jansson:           requested: ON, enabled: TRUE
```

- Compile and install:

```
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

The library will be installed to `/usr/local/lib` (or
`/usr/local/lib64`). Header files will land in
`/usr/local/include/libacars-2/libacars`.

#### Compiling libacars (Mac)

Install dependencies and tools with `brew`:

```
brew install cmake zlib libxml2 jansson
```

Then follow the above instructions for Linux. Just skip the final `sudo
ldconfig` step.

### Advanced compilation options

The following options may be used when invoking cmake:

- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` - enables debugging support.

- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` - disables debugging support (the default).

- `-DEMIT_ASN_DEBUG=ON` - enables debugging output of ASN.1 decoders (very
  verbose). This option requires `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, otherwise it will
  do nothing.

- `-DZLIB=FALSE` - forcefully disables zlib support. It will not be used even
  if zlib is available.

- `-DLIBXML2=FALSE` - disables libxml2 support.

- `-DJANSSON=FALSE` - disables Jansson support.

## Example applications

Example apps are provided in `examples` subdirectory:

- `decode_acars_apps` - reads messages from command line or from a file and
  decodes all ACARS applications supported by the library.

- `adsc_get_position` - illustrates how to extract position-related
  fields from decoded ADS-C message.

- `cpdlc_get_position` - illustrates how to extract position-related
  fields from CPDLC position reports.

Apps will be compiled together with the library. `make install` installs them
to `/usr/local/bin`.  Run each program with `-h` option for usage instructions.
